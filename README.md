# About FVP
This Python script implements Final Version Perfected, an algorithm for choosing important reminders [originally proposed by willbradshaw on LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xfcKYznQ6B9yuxB28/final-version-perfected-an-underused-execution-algorithm). 

## Installing + running
To install, just download this script and save it in your favorite folder. To run this script, run it in your favorite IDE. (This should be cross-platform, although I've only tested it on MacOS with IDLE - my current tech stack.)  The rest should be fairly intuitive.
